# Therabot Backend Development Documentation

This document outlines the steps to build the backend for Therabot, a mental health support application.

---

## Step 1: Plan the Backend Architecture

### Define the Scope
- **Features**:
  - Chatting with a chatbot (initial feature).
  - API development using Django.
- **Database Schema**:
  - **Users**: Authentication using OAuth.
  - **ChatHistory**: Stores conversations between users and chatbots.

### API Endpoints
- **Chat Interaction**: Endpoints for sending and retrieving messages.

---

## Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Use Django to create the project structure.
   - Install required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. **Version Control**:
   - Initialize a Git repository and set up `.gitignore` for sensitive files and virtual environments.

---

## Step 3: Build the Database

1. **Database Choice**:
   - Use PostgreSQL for production.
2. **Define Relationships**:
   - Design models for `Users` and `ChatHistory` with appropriate relationships.

---

## Step 4: Implement User Authentication

- Use OAuth for secure user authentication and authorization.

---

## Step 5: Create API Endpoints

1. **Define Routes**:
   - Set up routes for chat interaction, mood tracking, journaling, and exercises.
2. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - **Chat**: Send and retrieve messages.
   - **Mood Tracking**: Log and fetch mood data.
   - **Journaling**: Save and retrieve journal entries.
   - **Exercises**: Fetch exercise prompts and log completion.
3. **Add Pagination and Filtering**:
   - Implement pagination and filtering for endpoints returning large datasets (e.g., chat history).

---

## Step 6: Integrate External APIs

1. **Identify Required APIs**:
   - Integrate APIs for mindfulness exercises.
2. **Secure API Keys**:
   - Store API keys securely using environment variables.

---

## Step 7: Test the Backend

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write tests for individual components (e.g., models, views).
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components (e.g., API endpoints and database).

---

## Step 8: Document the APIs

- Use tools like Swagger or Postman to generate API documentation.

---

## Step 9: Prep for Deployment

1. **Set Up a Production Server**:
   - Use a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for deployment.
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Update settings for production (e.g., database, allowed hosts).

---

## Step 10: Deploy and Monitor

1. **Deploy**:
   - Push the application to the production server.
2. **Monitor**:
   - Use monitoring tools to track performance and errors.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is stored securely.
- Follow best practices for Django development and deployment.
